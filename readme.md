## Readme

This is my developer portfolio for the Module 2 challenge for the UNH coding bootcamp. I've supplied a basic layout with links to my
pre-work challenge and two game development projects I was involved with in the past. I hope to iterate and expand upon this as I learn more.
It is very bare bones right now and lacking polish but I will improve upon this as my skills grow.
